SQL Portfolio Project: Analyzing Xeven Solutions' Business Operations Using SQL Server

#  Overview

In this project, I performed end-to-end SQL-based analysis for Xeven Solutions, a tech company operating in diverse industries such as healthcare, energy, and artificial intelligence. Using SQL Server, I answered multiple real-world business questions by querying simulated enterprise data involving clients, projects, employees, departments, and AI tools.

This project demonstrates my ability to derive actionable business insights using structured query language, aggregate functions, joins, and analytical logic, reflecting practical problem-solving for operations, HR, project management, and revenue analysis.
